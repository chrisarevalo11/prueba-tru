# TRU technical test
## About the project
Welcome to the TRU token Faucet! This repository showcases the implementation of a faucet contract in the Ethereum blockchain, along with a web interface to interact with it. Regarding the project structure, there are two main packages inside apps folder: `contracts` & `web`. On the first hand, the contracts folder contains the implementation of the faucet. On the other hand, the web folder containg the implementation of the client where users can interact with the faucet 

**Faucet Functionality:**

The faucet contract implemented in this repository allows users to request TRU tokens. This is particularly useful for developers and testers who need TRU tokens which can be useful for testing purposes on a blockchain network, in this case Mumbai.

**Technology Stack:**

- **TurboRepo**: Efficiently manages the project structure.
- **Hardhat**: Used for Ethereum development, including compiling contracts and running tests.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling web interfaces.
- **ThirdWeb**: A library for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Ethers**: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Shadcn**: A Tailwind-based UI components library.

## Figma Design:
